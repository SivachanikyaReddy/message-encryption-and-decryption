# message-encryption-and-decryption
Purpose: Encrypts and decrypts messages using a substitution cipher with a shuffled character key.
Character Set: Supports spaces, punctuation, digits, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Key Generation: A shuffled version of the character set is used to substitute characters during encryption.
Encryption Process: Maps each character of the input message to its shuffled equivalent to form the encrypted message.
Decryption Process: Reverses the process by using the shuffled key to map encrypted characters back to their original form.
Usage: Input your message for encryption, and use the generated encrypted message for decryption.
